# In this file, please place all additional packages that are required for running your

# This typically includes packages like jupyter, black, pre-commit, etc
#
# If you want to pin a package to specific major version (e.g. any version that starts
# with 1.5.X) you can specify it as follows:
#
# mypackage>=1.5,<1.6
# or
# mypackage~=1.5.1
#
# Using mypackage==1.5 will fix your package to 1.5.0, which often is not desired
